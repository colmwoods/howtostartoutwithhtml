    <h4>The Basics</h4>
    <p>When Leaning The Basics Of HTML You Always Have To Remember That When You Learn It You Will Be Using It For Most Of HTML You Do Such As If You Spell Your First Watchord You Most Likely Will Be Using It
        For Word ETC

        <P>Here Are The 5 Basics You Need To Learn</P>
        <p>1. <b>HTML</b> : HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
             can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content: </p>
        <p>2. <b>Anatomy Of An HTML Element</b> :
            Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.
            
            paragraph element including opening tag, content reading 'my cat is very grumpy', and a closing tag
            The main parts of our element are as follows:
            
            The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
            The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
            The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element. </p>
        <p>3. <B>Images</B> :
            Let's turn our attention to the <img> element again:
            
            HTML
            Copy to Clipboard
            
            
            As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
            
            We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
            
            They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.
            Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:
            The words: my test image
            The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."
            
            Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now. </p>
        <p>4. <b>Lists</b> :
            A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
            
            Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a element.
            Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an element.
               </p>
        <p>5. <b>Links</b> :
            Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
            
            Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
            Wrap the text in an <a> element, as shown below:
            HTML
            Copy to Clipboard
            
            <a>Mozilla Manifesto</a>
            Give the <a> element an href attribute, as shown below:
            HTML
            Copy to Clipboard
            
            <a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
            Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:
            HTML
            Copy to Clipboard
            
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">
              Mozilla Manifesto
            </a>
            You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.  </p>
